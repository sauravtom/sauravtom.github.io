# About Saurav Kumar

## Overview

I'm Saurav Kumar, **Founder & CEO of xAGI Labs**. A two-time Y Combinator alumni (2019, 2020) and Applied AI Research Engineer specializing in Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain-specific AI applications. Featured on Google DeepMind podcast and Stripe Developers. As a serial entrepreneur with two successful exits and a TEDx speaker, I bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical business applications.

## Current Work

I run [xAGI Labs](https://github.com/xAGI-labs/), an AI product studio where we build AI applications that solve real business problems. My expertise lies in taking AI from concept to production, focusing on LLM fine-tuning, data pipeline engineering, and AI strategy consulting.

For the past three years, I've been building AI applications and search/recommendation systems that actually deliver value. I help startups transform their AI initiatives from proof-of-concept to production-ready systems that drive revenue.
