## Techniques for Predicting Sports Outcomes with Vedic Astrology

I recently picked up a book , [Gambler'S Dharma, Sports betting with vedic astrology by Simon Chokisky](https://archive.org/details/gamblersdharmasp0000chok).
This post is a summary of this book.

This book requires basic fundamentals of Vedic astrology as well as know-how of reading charts and being comfortable with vedic analysis.

Each game has a karmic signature as per vedic astrology, represented by its unique birth chart, calculated for the exact moment the match commences as well as the Home team and away team names.  

**Understanding the Layers of Prediction**

It's crucial to remember that Vedic astrological predictions are not based on single indicators but rather on a cumulative assessment of various techniques. These techniques are categorized in tiers, each building upon the previous one to provide a comprehensive picture.

**Tier One: Basic Techniques**

These initial techniques lay the foundation for deeper analysis.

* **Victory Houses:** This technique focuses on the placement of malefic planets (Saturn, Mars, Rahu, Ketu, and the Sun) in specific "upachaya houses." The presence of these planets in these houses signifies potential for victory.  
    * **Favored Team:** 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 11th houses from the ascendant.
    * **Underdog:** 9th, 12th, 4th, and 5th houses from the ascendant (corresponding to the 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 11th houses from their significator, the 7th house).
    * **Note:** Benefic planets in victory houses can also be advantageous, particularly when positioned strongly in their own sign or nakshatra, or when exalted or retrograde.
* **Navamsha Combinations:** This technique delves into the Navamsha chart (D9), which reveals the fruits of the main chart. Specific planet combinations in the 1st or 7th house of the Navamsha can indicate victory or loss:
    * **Sun + Ketu or Sun + Jupiter = Loss**
    * **Venus + Ketu or Moon + Rahu = Win**
    * **Moon + Saturn or Venus + Rahu = Loss**

**Tier Two: Intermediate Techniques**

These techniques refine the analysis, often resolving conflicting information from the basic techniques.

* **Cuspal Strength:** This technique analyzes the planets conjunct the cusps (beginning degrees) of the 1st and 7th houses in the game chart.
    * **Benefic Planets:** On the ascendant (1st house cusp) generally favor the favorite team, while malefic planets favor the underdog. The reverse is true for the 7th house.
    * **Note:** Mercury requires further research, Rahu is considered favorable on both cusps, and Ketu is generally negative. Outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Chiron) are also considered, with their influence often reversed when retrograde.
    * **Upaketu and Gulika (shadow planets):** Upaketu is negative on all cusps, while Gulika is negative on the 1st and 7th houses but can signify victory in the 10th.
    * **Influence Strength:** Proximity to the cusp determines a planet's influence.
    * **Conjunctions:** When two or more planets indicate the same outcome, it reinforces the prediction.
* **SKY/PKY (Shubha Kartari Yoga/Papa Kartari Yoga):** This technique identifies the presence of these yogas, formed when two planets hem in a house.
    * **SKY:** Formed by natural benefics, it protects the team it influences from conceding points.
    * **PKY:** Formed by malefic planets, it increases the team's vulnerability to conceding points.
    * **Note:** Rahu or Ketu alone do not form a complete PKY, often leading to a team playing well for half the game and poorly for the other half.
* **Sublords:** This technique assesses the strength of the sublords (planetary rulers) of the 1st and 7th house cusps.
    * **House Point Values:** Each house is assigned a point value based on its nature and relevance to the game outcome. 
    * **Sublord Point Comparison:** The difference in the point values of the 1st and 7th house sublords indicates the team more likely to be lucky or have spiritual fortitude on their side.
    * **Greater Difference:** A larger difference reinforces the prediction.

**Tier Three: Advanced Technique**

* **Navamsha Cuspal Strength:** This technique functions similarly to Cuspal Strength but applies it to the Navamsha chart, analyzing planets conjunct the cusps of the 1st and 7th houses in this subchart.  This is considered the most influential technique in determining game outcomes.

**Additional Techniques**

These techniques provide further refinement:

* **Planetary War (Graha Yuddha):** This occurs when two planets are within one degree of each other in the same sign. The planet with greater longitudinal degrees is considered the victor.
* **Moon Strength:** A strong Moon favors the favorite team, while a weak Moon favors the underdog.
* **Navamsha Syllables:** This technique compares syllables associated with the 10th house cusp (MC) in the Navamsha chart to the sounds in the team names.
* **Fixed Stars (Tara Balam):** This technique examines conjunctions between fixed stars and sensitive points in the horoscope, particularly house cusps. 

**To Conclude**

No single technique is foolproof. Accurate prediction requires a comprehensive assessment of all available information and a mindful approach, allowing intuition to guide the interpretation. Always consult with a qualified astrologer for personalized guidance.
