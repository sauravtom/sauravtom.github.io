## Next Steps for Google Knowledge Panel 🎯

### CRITICAL: Wikipedia/Wikidata (Highest Priority)

**Why it matters:** Google Knowledge Panels almost always require a Wikipedia page or Wikidata entry.

#### Option 1: Create a Wikipedia Page
**Notability Requirements:**
- ✅ Y Combinator alumni (highly notable)
- ✅ Presidential Award from Government of India
- ✅ Multiple startups with exits
- ✅ TEDx speaker
- ✅ Coverage in reliable sources (need to add)

**Steps:**
1. **Gather reliable sources** (MOST IMPORTANT):
   - News articles about your acquisitions (Likeo, Facecrop)
   - YC directory listing
   - News coverage of Presidential Award
   - TEDx talk video/coverage
   - Press articles about your startups
   - You need at least 3-5 independent, reliable sources

2. **Create Wikipedia draft**:
   - Start with [Wikipedia:Articles for creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_creation)
   - Follow [Wikipedia:Notability (people)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people))
   - Use neutral, encyclopedic tone (no marketing language)

3. **Get it reviewed**: Wikipedia editors will review for notability

#### Option 2: Create Wikidata Entry (Easier)
**Steps:**
1. Create account at [wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org)
2. Create new item for yourself
3. Add properties:
   - Name, occupation, employer
   - Links to your website, social profiles
   - Education (Y Combinator)
   - Awards received
   - Notable works

**Wikidata is easier but less powerful than Wikipedia for Knowledge Panels.**
